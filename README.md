# Classification-of-Near-Earth-Objects-NEOs-by-Potential-Hazard
In this project our goal is to classify the NEOâ€™s (Nearest Earth Objects) as they are hazardous or not.  We will be predicting whether it is hazardous or not, using features such as name, intrinsic luminosity, minimum estimated diameter, maximum estimated diameter, planet that asteroid orbits, velocity relative to earth, distance.
